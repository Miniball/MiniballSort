# Below are the default parameters that can be changed by uncommenting
# and passing this file to mb_sort during the histogramming stage.
#
# This file is not required to run mb_sort, but if you want meaningful
# physics histograms at the end, then you should change the parameters
# here to match your experiment. One can have multiple versions of this
# file to sort different runs or apply different recoil gates, etc.
# It is not yet implemented in the code, but it is envisaged to use the
# reaction information given here to determine which physics historgams
# to produce at the end, i.e. Coulex, transfer, etc.


## Reaction definition
#BeamA: 185		# mass number
#BeamZ: 80		# atomic number
#BeamE: 4500.	# the laboratory beam energy in keV per nucleon (note, not the usual MeV/u)
#TargetA: 120	#
#TargetZ: 50	#
#TargetT: 2.0	# target thickness in units if mg/cm^2
#EjectileA: 185	# Ejectile is the beam in Coulex, but the proton in (d,p)
#EjectileZ: 80	# we keep this language even though we have inverse kinematics
#RecoilA: 120	# Recoil is the target for Coulex, but the heavy ion in (d,p)
#RecoilZ: 80	# this ambiguity is needed to match the language of the users



## Detector geometry
#CD_0.Distance: 32.0	# Target to CD distance in mm (forwards CD = 32.0)
#CD_1.Distance: -64.0	# Target to CD distance in mm (backwards CD = -64.0)
#CD_0.PhiOffset: 0.0	# Phi rotation of CD with sector 0 strip 0 vertical, clockwise wrt beam direction
#CD_1.PhiOffset: 0.0	# Phi rotation of CD with sector 0 strip 0 vertical, anit-clockwise wrt beam direction because theta > 90 deg
#TargetOffset.X: 0.0	# Beam spot offset with respect to the vertical in mm (positive is up wrt beam direction)
#TargetOffset.Y: 0.0	# Beam spot offset with respect to the horizontal in mm (positive is right wrt beam direction)
#TargetOffset.Z: 0.0	# Beam spot offset with respect to the lateral in mm (positive is in beam direction) (doesn't affect CD distance)


# EBIS windows
#EBIS_On: 1.20e6		# slow extraction is about 1.2 ms
#EBIS_Off: 2.52e7		# Off window is 20 times the On window


## Particle cut files
#BeamCut_0.File: NULL		# ROOT file containing the beam-like energy vs angle cut in Coulex
#BeamCut_0.Name: CUTG		# name of the TCutG object inside the ROOT file
#TargetCut_0.File: NULL		# ROOT file containing the target-like energy vs angle cut in Coulex
#TargetCut_0.Name: CUTG		# name of the TCutG object inside the ROOT file
