## This file is an example input file for monitoring a list of histograms in DataSpy
## The first lines of the file can be comments if you start them with a '#'
## Please avoid using other comments in the file, the code doesn't know how to handle them yet
## The format is as follows
## Line 1 = <int>: number histograms in the x direction on the canvas
## Line 2 = <int>: number histograms in the y direction on the canvas
## Line 3 = <string> <string> <string>: histogram name, type and draw option
##  ... continued for as many histograms as you want to draw on a single canvas
## Line N = <string> <string> <string>: histogram name, type and draw option
